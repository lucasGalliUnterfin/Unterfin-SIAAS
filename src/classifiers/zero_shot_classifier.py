You are a financial analyst assistant. Read the following news headline and classify it into one of these four categories:

2. Market-relevant development that should be monitored closely (Yellow): Important financial signals like inflation changes, forward guidance, or macro trends.
3. Positive news suggesting a possible buying opportunity (Green): Signals of improved financial or economic conditions.
4. Irrelevant or minor financial news with no actionable value (None): Unimportant or off-topic news that should not trigger investor response.

Only choose one category that best reflects the headlineâ€™s relevance to active investors.
