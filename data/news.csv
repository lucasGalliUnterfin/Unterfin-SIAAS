This marked the sixth consecutive month of decline and the lowest level since January 2023, driven largely by lingering concerns over US tariffs, a sluggish domestic economy, and political instability. Although the US recently lowered its tariff on Thai imports from 36% to 19%, uncertainty remains over potential duties on transshipped goods from third countries via Thailand. Additionally, University President Thanavath Phonvichai noted that the economy is showing signs of stagnation and requires additional stimulus, projecting GDP growth of just 1.7% in 2025—down from a 2.5% expansion in 2024. Further clouding the outlook and eroding confidence was the political turmoil following Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s suspension, as she awaits a court ruling concerning alleged mishandling of a phone call with former Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.",/thailand/consumer-confidence

The gain tracked a rise in US stock futures after President Trump announced a plan to impose steep new tariffs on semiconductor imports. Wednesday's data also lifted sentiment, as the unemployment rate in New Zealand rose to its highest level since Q3 of 2020, raising hopes of interest rate cuts by the RBNZ at its upcoming meeting. However, traders were awaiting the release of trade data from China—New Zealand's top trading partner—later today, amid signs of easing trade tensions between the US and China and continued weak domestic demand. Investors also kept a close eye on US trade policy after Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods. All sectors moved into the green, led by IT, energy, and communication services.

This marked the fourth month of deflation, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 1%–3% target range. Despite the string of negative inflation readings, the Ministry of Commerce stated there were no signs of true deflation. A key factor behind was the decline in Dubai crude oil prices, following easing tensions in the Middle East after a ceasefire agreement. Other contributing factors included government measures to reduce living costs—such as cutting electricity rates from May to August—increased supplies of fresh vegetables, and promotional campaigns by large retailers aligned with the government’s stimulus efforts.

While New Zealand’s unemployment rate ticked up to a near five-year high of 5.2% in Q2, it was still a little below forecasts of 5.3%. This reinforced expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could cut rates at its meeting later this month. Markets now price in a 90% chance of a 25bps cut, with the potential for further easing to a floor of 2.75% later this year or early next.

Julapun noted that an additional THB 25 billion remains available for tariff-related and broader relief efforts. Separately, the government approved compensation for victims of last month’s border conflict with Cambodia: THB 10 million for families of fallen officials, up to THB 1 million for injured personnel, THB 8 million for families of deceased civilians, and up to THB 800,000 for civilians wounded in the clashes.",/thailand/news

Despite the monthly decline, the total number of new dwellings consented in the year ended June 2025 rose 1.0% to 33,979 compared to the previous year. The number of new dwellings consented per 1,000 residents remained steady at 6.4. Meanwhile, the annual value of non-residential building work consented fell 0.9% to $9.0 billion, indicating softness in the commercial construction sector.",/new-zealand/building-permits-mom
2025-07-31T22:11:56.623,NZ Consumer Confidence Drops as Recovery Stalls in July,"The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence index fell to 94.7 in July from 98.8 in June, continuing its recent volatile trend and signaling persistent economic weakness. The decline points to a sluggish recovery from last year’s recession, with weakening activity indicators and possible contractions in both GDP and employment in the June quarter. Consumer spending remains soft, as the share of households saying it’s a good time to buy a major item fell to -8, while the housing market continues to stagnate. Inflation expectations rose to 5.1%—the highest since April 2023—driven by rising costs in essentials such as food, insurance, and utilities. Perceptions of personal finances and economic conditions deteriorated further, weighing on future sentiment. However, easing mortgage rates and strong farm incomes may offer some support in the coming months, potentially paving the way for RBNZ rate cuts to aid the recovery.",/new-zealand/anz-roy-morgan-consumer-confidence-index
2025-07-31T08:13:28.833,Thailand Retail Sales Growth Slows,"Retail sales in Thailand rose by 26.1% year-on-year in May 2025, slowing from a 41.9% growth in the previous month. Sales increased at a softer pace for non-durable goods (1.7% vs 3.8% in April) and other goods (57.1% vs 89.3%). At the same time, sales declined for durable goods (-2.1% vs 0.6%) and motor vehicles and automotive fuel (-1.2% vs 0.7%). Meanwhile, sales in department stores, supermarkets and general stores rose further (21.7% vs 14%). On a monthly basis, retail activity dropped by 11.7% in May, reversing a 19.3% gain in April.",/thailand/retail-sales-annual
2025-07-31T07:54:22.383,Thailand Current Account Surplus Widens in June,"Thailand’s current account recorded a surplus of USD 2.4 billion in June 2025, widening from USD 1.7 billion in the same month of the previous year. The increase was mainly driven by a higher trade balance, which grew to USD 3.3 billion from USD 2.4 billion a year ago, with exports rising 16.1%, while imports increasing at a softer pace of 13.8%. Meanwhile, net deficit in services, primary income, and secondary income expanded to USD 0.9 billion from USD 0.8 billion in June last year.",/thailand/current-account
2025-07-31T07:41:35.82,Thailand Private Investment Recovers in June,"Private investment in Thailand rose by 0.7% month-on-month in June 2025, rebounding from a 0.6% decline in the previous month. The recovery was driven by a pickup in machinery and equipment investment, supported by higher domestic machinery sales and increased production of electrical equipment. Vehicle investment remained stable, as stronger imports of ships and increased registrations of pickup trucks offset declines in passenger car and truck registrations. Meanwhile, construction investment was broadly unchanged. Non-residential construction rose across all components, particularly in areas permitted for factory construction, while residential construction weakened, as reflected by a decline in permitted areas for single houses and townhouses.",/thailand/private-investment
2025-07-31T07:38:42.443,Thailand Personal Spending Falls in June,"Private consumption in Thailand fell by 0.3% month-on-month in June 2025, reversing a 0.2% gain in the previous month. Several spending categories declined, with services consumption down mainly due to reduced foreign tourist spending, although domestic tourism continued to grow. Spending on non-durable goods also weakened, dragged down by lower sales of fuel, consumer products, and alcoholic beverages. Durable goods consumption declined following a surge in car deliveries earlier in the year. In contrast, semi-durable goods saw modest gains, supported by higher imports of textiles and apparel. Consumer confidence continued to deteriorate amid growing concerns over US trade policy, weak demand recovery, and elevated household debt.",/thailand/personal-spending
2025-07-31T05:52:45.887,New Zealand Stocks Fall for 2nd Day,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index closed 0.25% lower at 12,824 on Thursday, marking its second consecutive session of losses. The local market mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where most US equities slipped after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again and gave no signal it plans to lower rates in September, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump. Further weighing on investor sentiment was the looming August 1 tariff deadline set by Trump, with several countries—including New Zealand—yet to clinch a deal. Moreover, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China raised fresh concerns over the economic outlook for New Zealand’s largest trading partner. On the corporate front, notable decliners included index heavyweights Auckland International Airport (-1.2%), Infratil (-3.1%), Mainfreight (-1.3%), Mercury NZ (-1.0%), and Spark NZ (-0.6%). The NZX 50 still posted a 1.75% gain in July, logging its third straight monthly rise.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-31T03:42:16.033,NZ Dollar Edges Up but Remains Vulnerable,"The New Zealand dollar edged up to around $0.591 on Thursday after sliding 1% overnight that marked its fifth consecutive session of declines. Despite the modest rebound, the kiwi remains under pressure due to broad US dollar strength, which extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to ease policy, and indicated that no decision had been made regarding a widely anticipated cut in September. Investors also remained cautious as Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline is around the corner and several countries—including New Zealand—have yet to strike a deal. Adding further pressure, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China stoked fresh concerns over the health of its economy. Given that China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, any signs of Chinese economic weakness typically weigh on the kiwi. The New Zealand dollar is heading for a monthly loss of nearly 3%, on track to break a four-month streak of gains.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-07-30T23:05:32.133,New Zealand Equities Poised for Third Straight Monthly Gain,"The NZX 50 was little changed at around 12,860 on Thursday morning, after closing lower in the prior session, as strength in commercial services and consumer durables was offset by weakness in logistics and non-energy minerals. Traders digested the U.S. Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, though two governors dissented—the first double dissent since 1993. Locally, New Zealand’s business sentiment rose to a three-month high in July, on easing inflation expectations and a tight labor market. The benchmark index remains on track for a third consecutive monthly gain, up about 2% so far, amid optimism after the U.S. and China agreed to explore an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplaying concerns that President Trump might reject the deal. Top gainers included Winton Land (4.0%), South Port NZ (2.35%), and Freightways Group (1.7%), while Fletcher Building (-1.6%), Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (-0.7%), and Mercury NZ (-0.6%) fell.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-30T13:26:53.43,Mexican Peso Slips to 1-Month Low on Strong USD,"The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows as a broad rebound in the US dollar, further supported by a 3% annualized GDP surge in Q2, dovetailing with high-profile US–EU and US–Japan trade agreements that capped tariff-war fears, overwhelmed Mexico’s otherwise robust economic backdrop. As expected, the Fed held rates at 4.25%–4.50%, revised down its H1 growth outlook to “moderation” from “solid pace,” and, for the first time since 1993, saw two governors dissent in favor of a September rate cut. Back home, Mexico’s economy expanded 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in Q2, its strongest pace since late 2024 and well ahead of the 0.4% consensus, just as unemployment fell to 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, underscoring a tight labor market. Banxico’s high interest rate, and the expectation it will stay that way, keeps real yields attractive for carry-trade investors. While these inflows provide some support, they’ve only partly cushioned the peso from the dollar’s strength.",/mexico/currency
2025-07-30T12:09:59.143,Mexican GDP Grows More than Expected,"The Mexican GDP expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% from the previous quarter in the second quarter of 2025, well above market expectations of a 0.4% increase, to mark the sharpest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2024. Growth was carried by the services sector (0.7% vs -0.1% in Q1) and manufacturing (0.8% vs -0.%), which offset the 1.3% plunge for primary industries, trimming surges of over 6.5% in the two previous quarters. From the previous year, the Mexican GDP expanded by a softer 0.1%.",/mexico/gdp-growth
2025-07-30T08:07:17.87,Thailand Industrial Output Growth Below Forecasts,"Thailand’s industrial production rose by 0.58% yoy in June 2025, significantly below expectations of 2.0% growth, and down from an upwardly revised 1.94% increase in May. While this marked the fourth consecutive month of expansion, it was the softest growth since March. The upturn was driven by strong growth in output from automotive manufacturing (17.02%), clothing and apparel (11.84%), electronic components and circuit boards (6.18%), and computer and peripherals (2.00%). By contrast, output fell in food products (-0.22%), basic iron and steel (-0.58%), rubber and plastic products (-0.81%), and petroleum refining (-3.15%). On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, industrial production contracted by 1.71% in June, following a revised 0.16% drop in May. In April, the Industry Ministry lowered its 2025 industrial growth forecast to a range of 0%–1%, down from an earlier projection of 1.5%–2.5%, citing uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and elevated household debt as key headwinds.",/thailand/industrial-production
2025-07-30T08:05:23.71,Sweden Consumer Confidence at 5-Month High,"Sweden's consumer confidence indicator jumped to 90.7 in July 2025 from an upwardly revised 84.9 in the previous month, marking the highest reading since February. The upturn was broad-based, with all sub-indices posting increases. Notably, sentiment regarding households’ own financial situation strengthened significantly—both in terms of developments over the past twelve months and expectations for the year ahead.",/sweden/consumer-confidence
2025-07-30T07:25:03.787,Sweden Economic Tendency Indicator Rises in July,"The Economic Tendency Indicator for Sweden rose to 94.3 in July 2025, from a fifteen-month low of 92.7 in June. Consumer confidence saw a sharp increase, climbing to 90.7 from 84.9 in June—the second-largest monthly increase since the series began in 1996—with improvements across all sub-components. Despite this positive development among consumers, it remains the sector with the weakest sentiment overall. At the same time, business sentiment improved (97 vs 95 in June), particularly in the retail (102.1 vs 98.2) and services (96.4 vs 93.3) sectors. However, confidence weakened in the manufacturing (96.3 vs 98.7) and construction (97.7 vs 98.6) sectors.",/sweden/leading-economic-index
2025-07-30T06:22:35.473,Sweden Retail Sales Rebound in June,"Retail sales in Sweden rose by 2.5% year-on-year in June 2025, rebounding from an upwardly revised 1.9% decline in the previous month. The recovery was largely driven by a sharp increase in durable goods sales, which rose 5.3% after falling 1.5% in May. In contrast, sales of consumables continued to decline, down 1.1% following a 1.4% drop previously. On a monthly basis, retail sales grew by 2.4%, sharply recovering from a downwardly revised 4.6% fall in May and marking the strongest monthly gain since December 2024. Over the April–June period, retail sales decreased by 0.6% compared to the preceding three-month period (January–March).",/sweden/retail-sales-annual
2025-07-30T06:09:51.067,New Zealand Stocks Snap 4-day Win Streak,"The S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.6% to close at 12,856 on Wednesday, snapping a four-day run of gains. Investors turned cautious after US-China trade talks concluded without any major breakthroughs. Although both sides agreed to seek an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, the final decision is up to President Trump. Adding to concerns, New Zealand—currently subject to Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs—could face higher levies of 15% to 20% if a deal isn't reached soon. Meanwhile, expectations that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates steady this week also contributed to the cautious mood. On the domestic front, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum. In corporate news, Mainfreight was the session’s biggest drag, plunging 9.6% after the logistics company reported a slow and disappointing start to FY2026, with profits down across its three main divisions.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-30T03:51:57.623,NZ Dollar Rebounds as US Dollar Softens,"The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.596 on Wednesday, ending a four-day losing streak, supported by a weaker US dollar. The greenback retreated as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision. While the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady, investors will be watching closely for any hints of a potential rate cut in September. On the trade front, the US and China concluded two days of talks described by both sides as “constructive,” agreeing to continue working to extend their 90-day tariff truce. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that any extension would ultimately depend on President Donald Trump, leaving a degree of uncertainty in the outlook. In domestic news, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-07-30T01:11:01.933,New Zealand Business Sentiment Hits 3-Month Peak,"New Zealand’s ANZ Business Outlook Index rose to 47.8 in July 2025 from 46.3 in June, marking a second straight monthly gain and the highest print since April. The improvement was supported by a lift in past own activity (5.9 vs 2.3 in June), though forward-looking activity was little changed (40.6 vs 40.9). Export intentions edged up (14.6 vs 13.9), and employment intentions also improved (11.8 vs 10.8), while investment intentions held steady (19.7 vs 19.9). Pricing intentions fell to their lowest since December 2024, amid easing inflation expectations (2.68% vs 2.71%). Cost expectations dipped but remained high (75.9 vs 79.0), while wage expectations rose (79.1 vs 76.1), pointing to lingering labor market tightness. Credit availability remained broadly stable (15.0 vs 15.9). However, residential construction slumped sharply to a one-year low (16.7 vs 44.8), contrasting with continued strength in commercial construction (28.9 vs 28.1), which stayed positive for a 13th straight month.",/new-zealand/business-confidence
2025-07-29T23:08:57.323,New Zealand Shares Subdued,"New Zealand stocks were little changed in Wednesday morning trade, hovering around 12,930 after four straight sessions of gains. Strength in commercial services and utilities offset losses in industrial services and consumer non-durables. Investors cautiously awaited July’s business sentiment data, due later today, after June marked the first rise since February. In Australia, key monthly and quarterly inflation reports are scheduled for release later today. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended a six-day rally Tuesday as traders digested a wave of corporate earnings and closely tracked U.S.-China trade negotiations. Attention also turned to the Fed’s rate decision due later today, with President Trump renewing calls for rate cuts. U.S. inflation data later in the week added to the cautious mood. Colonial Motor Co. fell 2.1%, followed by Restaurant Brands NZ (-2.0%), and T&G Global (-1.8%). On the upside, PGG Wrightson rose 1.8%, Meridian Energy gained 1.2%, and Scales Corp. added 1.1%.",/new-zealand/stock-market
