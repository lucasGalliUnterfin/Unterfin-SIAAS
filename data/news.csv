2025-08-08T06:21:37.917,Swedish Household Spending Bounces Back in June,"Household spending in Sweden increased by 0.6% month-on-month in June 2025, rebounding from a downwardly revised 0.9% decline in May. The recovery was primarily driven by a rebound in transport, retail sales, and motor vehicle services (2.6% vs -0.2% in May), clothing and footwear (8.2% vs -11.7%), and recreation and culture goods and services (2.5% vs -2.6%). Meanwhile, spending growth moderated for other goods and services (0.2% vs 0.8%). Declines in food and beverages (-0.8% vs -2.9%) and furniture, furnishings, household equipment, and consumables (-0.5% vs -3.0%) were also less pronounced, helping to ease some pressure on overall consumption. In contrast, spending declined in housing, electricity, gas, and heating (-0.4% vs 0.8%), post and communications (-0.6% vs 2.7%), and restaurants, cafes, hotels, and other accommodation services (-2.2% vs 3.0%).

This marked the highest reading since December 2024, as output recovered significantly for mining and quarrying (30.8% vs -0.6% in May). At the same time, output increased at a faster pace for manufacturing (12% vs 3%). On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, industrial output rose by 6.5% in June 2025, rebounding from a downwardly revised 0.6% fall in the previous month.",/sweden/industrial-production

The increase was solely driven by a sharp rebound in domestic demand, which climbed 7.6% after a 7% decline in May. Meanwhile, export orders continued to fall, down 2.6% following a 2.2% drop previously. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, new orders rose by 5.7%, ending a two-month decline of 3.7% in May and 6.6% in April. Most industrial subsectors saw positive developments in both domestic and export markets compared to May. Year-to-date, total industry orders were 5.7% higher than in the same period from January to June 2024.",/sweden/new-orders
2025-08-08T05:36:51.73,New Zealand Stocks Fall Amid Tariff Concerns,"The S&P/NZX 50 index slipped 0.3% to close at 12,845 on Friday, as investors expressed concern over the impact of newly imposed tariffs on the domestic economy. A 15% tariff on New Zealand exports to the US took effect on Thursday, raising risks for the country’s export-driven economy. Traders were also on edge ahead of China’s consumer and producer price data due Saturday, with forecasts pointing to a renewed drop in the CPI, underscoring persistently weak domestic demand in New Zealand’s largest trading partner. Despite Friday’s decline, the NZX 50 rose 0.9% for the week, ending a two-week losing streak, underpinned by rising expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand may cut rates later this month, following a weak jobs report. On the corporate front, heavyweights Meridian Energy (-1.2%), Infratil (-1.5%), and a2 Milk (-0.8%) led the downturn. Other notable decliners included Summerset Group (-2.2%), Oceania (-2.9%), Gentrack Group (-1.8%), and Fletcher Building (-1%).",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-08T02:51:07.873,New Zealand Dollar Holds at 1-Week High,"The New Zealand dollar steadied at $0.596 on Friday, hovering at its highest level in a week, supported by a softer US dollar. The greenback remained under pressure amid growing bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut in September and concerns about the impact of new tariffs on the US economy. The kiwi also found support from still strong trade data from China—New Zealand’s largest trading partner—which showed export growth beat forecasts in July, offering some relief amid a fragile tariff truce between Beijing and Washington. Domestically, however, sentiment was tempered by recent labor market data pointing to continued weakness, reinforcing expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could lower interest rates at its meeting later this month. Adding to the headwinds, a new 15% US tariff on New Zealand exports took effect on Thursday, posing fresh risks to the country’s export-reliant economy. For the week, the NZD is up 0.8%.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-08-07T23:13:33.077,New Zealand Stocks Edge Lower but Point to Weekly Gain,"The NZX 50 dropped 18 points, or 0.1%, to 12,867 in morning trade on Friday, after remaining nearly flat over the previous month, weighed down by healthcare, industrials, and communication services. Traders continued to monitor developments in US trade tariff policy amid signs of renewed trade tensions, following President Trump’s decision to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports. Caution also grew ahead of the release of consumer and producer prices in China — New Zealand’s main trading partner — due on Saturday. Markets expect the CPI to return to decline amid continued weak demand in the mainland. A slew of data from China, including retail sales and industrial production, is set to be announced next week. Among early losers were South Port NZ (-3.0%), Fisher & Paykel (-1.2%), and ANZ Group (-0.8%). However, the index remains on track for a 1.2% weekly gain — its first rise in three weeks — amid hopes of interest rate cuts at the upcoming RBNZ meeting.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-07T19:50:36.17,Mexican Peso Halts Recovery After Banxico,"The Mexican peso weakened past 18.6 per USD, halting its rebound from the one-month low of 18.88 touched on August 4th, after Banxico lowered its overnight rate to 7.75%, trimming some of the carry appeal that had recently underpinned the currency. The move followed a drop in annual inflation from 4.51% in mid-June to 3.51% in July, and slightly stronger economic growth in Q2 compared to Q1, though underlying slack persists. Still, the central bank struck a cautious tone, flagging global trade frictions and geopolitical risks as potential inflationary triggers through peso depreciation or as downside threats to growth. Meanwhile, Washington imposed new tariffs, 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum from Mexico, with duties on auto parts set to follow next week, posing fresh risks to export revenues and industrial output.",/mexico/currency
2025-08-07T19:28:45.243,"Banxico Lowers Interest Rate to 7.75%, as Expected","The Bank of Mexico lowered its key rate by 25 bps to 7.75% in its August meeting, as annual inflation declined from 4.51% in mid-June to 3.51% in July and the domestic economy expanded at a slightly faster pace in Q2 than in Q1, though slack persists. The release indicated that the Board deemed appropriate a continued cycle of rate cuts, taking into account the degree of monetary restriction implemented and anticipating that the ongoing disinflation process will allow further easing while preserving a restrictive stance. However, the central bank remains cautious amid elevated global uncertainty, from trade tensions to geopolitical conflicts, that could reignite inflation via peso depreciation or deepen the economic slowdown. While progress toward the 3% inflation target remains on track, with forecasts unchanged and still pointing to convergence by the third quarter of 2026, members underscored the importance of a flexible policy framework.",/mexico/interest-rate
2025-08-07T13:39:03.353,Mexico Inflation Rate Eases to 2020-Lows in July,"Mexico’s annual inflation rate slowed to 3.51% in July 2025 from 4.32% in June, broadly in line with market expectations of 3.53%. This marks the lowest year-on-year inflation rate since 2020. Price increases eased for agricultural products (0.17% vs 5.04%), energy (0.78% vs 3.56%), and services (4.44% vs 4.62%). Meanwhile, inflation accelerated for goods (4.02% vs 3.91%) and for food, beverages, and tobacco (5.13% vs 4.89%). Core inflation edged down slightly to 4.23% from 4.24% in June. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.27%, just below the 0.28% increase recorded in the previous month.",/mexico/inflation-cpi
2025-08-07T13:00:17.6,Mexico's Auto Exports Continue to Rise,"Mexico’s car exports climbed by 7.9% year-on-year to 289,598 units in July 2025, following a 14% jump in the prior month. Among the main exporters, shipments increased primarily for Volkswagen (+30.6% to 30,682), Stellantis (+24.3% to 32,479) and General Motors (+22% to 69,707). However, steep declines were recorded for BMW Group (-38.2% to 7,210), Honda (-20.9% to 20,233) and Mercedes-Benz (-17.7% to 6,082). In the first six months of 2025, exports fell by 1.4% to 1.96 million units. The United States was the main destination, accounting for 79.3% of total, followed by Canada (10.9%) and Germany (2.8%).",/mexico/auto-exports
2025-08-07T12:21:57.55,Mexico’s Car Output Up for 2nd Month,"Mexico's car production rose by 2.4% year-on-year to 309,453 units in July 2025, following a 4.9% increase in the prior month, signaling resilience in the sector despite the ongoing harmful US trade policy.  Among major automakers, the strongest increases were observed for Stellantis (+42% to 38,821), Toyota (+13.3% to 22,881), Nissan (+11.7% to 47,452) and BMW (+10.5% to 9,106).

2025-08-07T06:32:11.12,Thailand Consumer Confidence at 2½-Year Low,"The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce’s consumer confidence index fell to 51.7 in July 2025, from 52.7 in the previous month. This marked the sixth consecutive month of decline and the lowest level since January 2023, driven largely by lingering concerns over US tariffs, a sluggish domestic economy, and political instability. Although the US recently lowered its tariff on Thai imports from 36% to 19%, uncertainty remains over potential duties on transshipped goods from third countries via Thailand. Additionally, University President Thanavath Phonvichai noted that the economy is showing signs of stagnation and requires additional stimulus, projecting GDP growth of just 1.7% in 2025—down from a 2.5% expansion in 2024. Further clouding the outlook and eroding confidence was the political turmoil following Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s suspension, as she awaits a court ruling concerning alleged mishandling of a phone call with former Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.",/thailand/consumer-confidence
2025-08-07T06:19:36.503,Sweden Inflation Edges Up to 0.8% in July,"Sweden’s annual inflation rate edged up to 0.8% in July 2025 from 0.7% in the previous month, but missing market expectations of 0.9%, a preliminary estimate showed. This marked the highest reading since February but remained well below the Riksbank’s 2% target. On a monthly basis, consumer prices advanced 0.2%, slowing from a 0.5% rise in June. Meanwhile, the CPI with a fixed interest rate (CPIF), the Riksbank’s target measure, rose 2.8% year-on-year in July, slightly easing from a 3.0% increase in the previous month and coming in below market forecasts of a 3.0% growth.",/sweden/inflation-cpi
2025-08-07T05:59:02.31,New Zealand Stocks End Little Changed,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index ended Thursday’s session nearly flat at 12,887, as investors stayed on the sidelines amid concerns over newly imposed US tariffs. The sweeping reciprocal tariffs have now taken effect, including a higher 15% duty on New Zealand exports. Meanwhile, trade data from China — New Zealand's largest trading partner — showed exports beat forecasts in July amid a fragile tariff truce between Beijing and Washington. Domestically, labor market data released this week pointed to continued softness, reinforcing expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. On the corporate front, notable gainers included Spark NZ (+1.8%) and Chorus (+1.2%), while Contact Energy (-0.8%) and Summerset (-1.3%) were among the key decliners.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-07T03:10:16.943,New Zealand 2-Year Inflation Expectations at 2.28%,"The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) quarterly survey of expectations showed that business managers forecast inflation at 2.28% for the next two years in Q3 2025, edging down from 2.29% in the previous three-month period. Additionally, one-year inflation expectations eased to 2.37% from 2.41%. Meanwhile, longer-term projections showed that five-year-ahead inflation expectations increased to 2.26% from 2.18%, while ten-year expectations remained unchanged at 2.15%.

2025-08-06T23:08:05.343,New Zealand Equities Rise in Early Trade,"The NZX 50 climbed 44 points, or 0.3%, to 12,924 in early trading on Thursday, after being flat in the previous session. The gain tracked a rise in US stock futures after President Trump announced a plan to impose steep new tariffs on semiconductor imports. Wednesday's data also lifted sentiment, as the unemployment rate in New Zealand rose to its highest level since Q3 of 2020, raising hopes of interest rate cuts by the RBNZ at its upcoming meeting. However, traders were awaiting the release of trade data from China—New Zealand's top trading partner—later today, amid signs of easing trade tensions between the US and China and continued weak domestic demand. Investors also kept a close eye on US trade policy after Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods. All sectors moved into the green, led by IT, energy, and communication services. Among the early gainers were Seek (up 1.3%), Ryman Healthcare (1.2%), Scales Corp. (0.9%), FC Investment (0.8%), and ANZ Group (0.6%).",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-06T05:52:56.19,New Zealand Stocks Close Flat,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index ended flat at 12,880 on Wednesday, as investors digested the domestic jobs report. The unemployment rate edged up to a near five-year high of 5.2% in Q2, from 5.1% in Q1, but it was below the forecasted 5.3%. The data pointed to continued softness in the labor market, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand at its meeting later this month. Markets are now pricing in a 90% chance of a 25bps cut, with the potential for further easing to a floor of 2.75% later this year or early next. Meanwhile, concerns persist over the outlook for New Zealand’s export-reliant economy, which faces a higher 15% US tariff set to take effect on August 7. Among notable large-cap movers, Infratil gained 1.3% and Spark NZ added 1%, while Auckland Intl Airport lost 1.2% and Meridian Energy slipped 0.9%.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-06T03:48:39.697,Thailand Consumer Prices Fall for 4th Month,"Consumer prices in Thailand fell by 0.70% year-on-year in July 2025, a steeper decline than the expected 0.45% drop and following a 0.25% decrease in June. This marked the fourth month of deflation, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 1%–3% target range. Despite the string of negative inflation readings, the Ministry of Commerce stated there were no signs of true deflation. A key factor behind was the decline in Dubai crude oil prices, following easing tensions in the Middle East after a ceasefire agreement. Other contributing factors included government measures to reduce living costs—such as cutting electricity rates from May to August—increased supplies of fresh vegetables, and promotional campaigns by large retailers aligned with the government’s stimulus efforts. Meanwhile, core consumer prices, rose 0.84% year-on-year, the slowest pace of growth in six months, slightly below the forecasted 0.90% and easing from a 1.06% gain in June.",/thailand/inflation-cpi
2025-08-06T02:56:07.24,NZ Dollar Rises on Weaker Greenback,"The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.595, hitting a one-week high, as the US dollar continued to struggle amid higher prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Mounting concerns about the US economy—particularly signs of a cooling labor market—have bolstered bets on a September rate cut. However, the kiwi's gains may be limited by a weaker-than-expected local jobs report. While New Zealand’s unemployment rate ticked up to a near five-year high of 5.2% in Q2, it was still a little below forecasts of 5.3%. This reinforced expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could cut rates at its meeting later this month.

The cabinet also authorized the government to draft a joint statement on trade with the U.S., though talks are still ongoing with no set signing date. The U.S. recently imposed a 19% tariff on Thai imports, lower than the earlier proposed 36% and more in line with regional peers. Julapun noted that an additional THB 25 billion remains available for tariff-related and broader relief efforts. Separately, the government approved compensation for victims of last month’s border conflict with Cambodia: THB 10 million for families of fallen officials, up to THB 1 million for injured personnel, THB 8 million for families of deceased civilians, and up to THB 800,000 for civilians wounded in the clashes.",/thailand/news
2025-08-05T23:08:30.47,New Zealand Shares Drop After Jobs Data Release,"Equities in New Zealand fell 24 points, or 0.2%, to 12,853 in morning trade on Wednesday, halting gains from the previous session after fresh data showed the unemployment rate rose to 5.2% in Q2 — the highest since Q3 2020 — though slightly below market expectations of 5.3%. The data raised concerns about New Zealand’s economic outlook, amid additional headwinds from newly announced 15% US tariffs. The NZX 50 tracked a downbeat session on Wall Street on Tuesday amid rising trade tensions, disappointing economic data, and mixed corporate earnings. Traders also continued to monitor the US trade tariff policy after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical imports.

Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted labour force participation rate dipped to 70.5% from 70.7% in the previous quarter, indicating a slight contraction in workforce engagement. The underutilisation rate—a broader measure of spare labour capacity—also climbed to 12.8%, up from 12.4% in March and 11.9% a year earlier.

The fall was mainly driven by a 10.3% decline in machinery and equipment investment, largely due to a 28.6% plunge in imported transport equipment. Overall investment in imported goods dropped 13.7%, while investment in national goods fell 4.8%. Construction activity also declined, with non-residential building down 17.5%, offsetting a 9.6% rise in residential construction.

The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.3%, the highest since Q4 2016, reinforcing expectations for a rate cut by the central bank at its upcoming meeting this month. Traders also continued to brace for the US to raise tariffs on New Zealand goods from 10% to 15% starting August 7, heightening concerns about economic repercussions and putting pressure on key export sectors. Meanwhile, data showed a surprisingly strong performance in China’s services sector in July, easing concerns over Kiwi exports given the close trade relationship.

The market expects the unemployment rate to rise to 5.3%, the highest since Q4 2016, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the central bank at its upcoming meeting this month. Meanwhile, starting August 7, the US will raise tariffs on New Zealand goods from 10% to 15%, fueling concerns about the potential economic impact and putting pressure on key export sectors. However, economists believe the overall effect will be manageable, supported by strong commodity prices. Elsewhere, private data showed an unexpectedly strong performance in China’s services sector in July, helping ease concerns over Kiwi exports due to close trade ties. A softer US dollar also provided some support, following a weaker-than-expected US jobs report that boosted expectations for earlier rate cuts.",/new-zealand/currency

Traders anticipated the release of New Zealand's unemployment data for Q2 later this week, with the market expecting it to rise to 5.3% — the highest since Q4 of 2016 — raising hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting this month. However, traders continued to monitor the development of US trade tariff policy and were anticipating the release of services PMI data from China, New Zealand's top trading partner, later today.

The US is set to raise tariffs on New Zealand products from 10% to 15% effective August 7, fueling concerns over economic fallout and putting New Zealand at a disadvantage in key exports. Still, economists believe the effect will be manageable given strong commodity prices. New Zealand officials are reportedly heading to Washington following last week’s announcement. Meanwhile, adding to market caution was New Zealand’s Q2 unemployment data and upcoming trade and CPI figures from top trading partner China due later this week.

The gains came amid a relatively soft US dollar and as traders assessed the impact of new US tariffs. The greenback weakened last week following a disappointing US jobs report and President Donald Trump's dismissal of a top labor official, prompting markets to price in two potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, with the first expected in September. Meanwhile, the US is set to raise tariffs on New Zealand products to 15% from 10%, effective August 7, heightening concerns about the economic impact and putting New Zealand at a disadvantage in key exports.

The NZX 50 hit its lowest level since mid-July, weighed down primarily by tech, communication services, and financial stocks. Traders remained focused on the development of US tariffs, as New Zealand’s top diplomat, Vangelis Vitalis, flew to Washington following last week’s announcement that the US would impose a 15% tariff—an increase from the 10% initially threatened in April. Trade Minister Todd McClay is also expected to visit Washington in the coming days, according to local media reports.

July’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI remained in contraction at 49.1 for the thirteenth consecutive month, while business confidence sat below breakeven at 49.4, signaling subdued export demand and muted capital expenditure. At the same time, the looming threat of 50% steel and aluminum duties and 25% levies on autos, even after a 90-day reprieve, has stoked risk aversion toward peso assets, as market participants fear a hit to trade flows and corporate earnings.",/mexico/currency

The rise reflects a marginal easing in new orders, which firms attributed to lingering US tariffs and heightened competition from Chinese imports. Factory output also fell, albeit at the mildest pace since February, while purchasing activity declined for the seventh consecutive month as companies sought to adjust inventories amid persistent cost pressures. Employment decreased for the fifteenth month running, though at the slowest rate in the current period of job shedding. Input prices continued to climb at the steepest rate in three months, yet most producers absorbed these higher costs, with selling prices rising only marginally.

Payrolls in the US were revised sharply lower and the unemployment rate rose despite a lower labor force. Meanwhile, US trade levies on New Zealand were raised to 15% from the 10% baseline announced in April. The new tariff rate, set to take effect next week, has fueled concerns about the outlook for New Zealand’s export-driven economy.

The largest positive contribution came from the sub-index for incoming orders (56.2 vs 48.8 in June), followed by suppliers' delivery times (53.1 vs 50.7) and inventory purchases (46.4 vs 47.5). However, the sub-indices for production (54.8 vs 55.6) and employment (51.7 vs 52.1) contributed negatively.

Adding further downward pressure is a broadly stronger US dollar, buoyed by a hawkish Federal Reserve and continued signs of resilience in the US economy. Investors are now awaiting the release of US non-farm payrolls data later in the day for more clues on the Fed's rate path.

This reflected growing momentum in production activity and business conditions. New orders grew at the fastest pace so far this year, supported by rising client interest and stronger export demand. In response, manufacturers ramped up production and purchasing activity, leading to higher input inventories. Employment levels also picked up after stalling in June, helping reduce backlogs. Meanwhile, output price inflation eased close to neutral as input costs fell slightly, thanks to supplier discounts and bulk buying. However, stocks of finished goods dipped again amid outbound shipments.

The NZX 50 is on track for a second straight weekly loss, down about 0.3% so far, amid reports of weakening consumer sentiment driven by concerns over potential GDP and employment contractions in Q2. In China, New Zealand’s key trading partner, services activity in July grew the least in eight months, while factory output shrank for a fourth straight month. Still, losses were capped by hopes that the RBNZ may ease policy further amid subdued inflation.

The decline points to a sluggish recovery from last year’s recession, with weakening activity indicators and possible contractions in both GDP and employment in the June quarter. Consumer spending remains soft, as the share of households saying it’s a good time to buy a major item fell to -8, while the housing market continues to stagnate. Inflation expectations rose to 5.1%—the highest since April 2023—driven by rising costs in essentials such as food, insurance, and utilities.

The increase was mainly driven by a higher trade balance, which grew to USD 3.3 billion from USD 2.4 billion a year ago, with exports rising 16.1%, while imports increasing at a softer pace of 13.8%.

The recovery was driven by a pickup in machinery and equipment investment, supported by higher domestic machinery sales and increased production of electrical equipment. Vehicle investment remained stable, as stronger imports of ships and increased registrations of pickup trucks offset declines in passenger car and truck registrations. Meanwhile, construction investment was broadly unchanged. Non-residential construction rose across all components, particularly in areas permitted for factory construction, while residential construction weakened, as reflected by a decline in permitted areas for single houses and townhouses.",/thailand/private-investment

Spending on non-durable goods also weakened, dragged down by lower sales of fuel, consumer products, and alcoholic beverages. Durable goods consumption declined following a surge in car deliveries earlier in the year. In contrast, semi-durable goods saw modest gains, supported by higher imports of textiles and apparel.

The local market mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where most US equities slipped after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again and gave no signal it plans to lower rates in September, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump. Further weighing on investor sentiment was the looming August 1 tariff deadline set by Trump, with several countries—including New Zealand—yet to clinch a deal. Moreover, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China raised fresh concerns over the economic outlook for New Zealand’s largest trading partner.

Despite the modest rebound, the kiwi remains under pressure due to broad US dollar strength, which extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to ease policy, and indicated that no decision had been made regarding a widely anticipated cut in September. Investors also remained cautious as Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline is around the corner and several countries—including New Zealand—have yet to strike a deal. Adding further pressure, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China stoked fresh concerns over the health of its economy. Given that China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, any signs of Chinese economic weakness typically weigh on the kiwi. The New Zealand dollar is heading for a monthly loss of nearly 3%, on track to break a four-month streak of gains.",/new-zealand/currency

Traders digested the U.S. Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, though two governors dissented—the first double dissent since 1993. Locally, New Zealand’s business sentiment rose to a three-month high in July, on easing inflation expectations and a tight labor market. The benchmark index remains on track for a third consecutive monthly gain, up about 2% so far, amid optimism after the U.S. and China agreed to explore an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplaying concerns that President Trump might reject the deal.
