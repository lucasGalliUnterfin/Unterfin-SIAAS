In the first six months of 2025, exports fell by 1.4% to 1.96 million units. The United States was the main destination, accounting for 79.3% of total, followed by Canada (10.9%) and Germany (2.8%).",/mexico/auto-exports
2025-08-07T12:21:57.55,Mexico’s Car Output Up for 2nd Month,"Mexico's car production rose by 2.4% year-on-year to 309,453 units in July 2025, following a 4.9% increase in the prior month, signaling resilience in the sector despite the ongoing harmful US trade policy.

2025-08-07T06:32:11.12,Thailand Consumer Confidence at 2½-Year Low,"The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce’s consumer confidence index fell to 51.7 in July 2025, from 52.7 in the previous month. This marked the sixth consecutive month of decline and the lowest level since January 2023, driven largely by lingering concerns over US tariffs, a sluggish domestic economy, and political instability. Although the US recently lowered its tariff on Thai imports from 36% to 19%, uncertainty remains over potential duties on transshipped goods from third countries via Thailand. Additionally, University President Thanavath Phonvichai noted that the economy is showing signs of stagnation and requires additional stimulus, projecting GDP growth of just 1.7% in 2025—down from a 2.5% expansion in 2024. Further clouding the outlook and eroding confidence was the political turmoil following Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s suspension, as she awaits a court ruling concerning alleged mishandling of a phone call with former Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.",/thailand/consumer-confidence
2025-08-07T06:19:36.503,Sweden Inflation Edges Up to 0.8% in July,"Sweden’s annual inflation rate edged up to 0.8% in July 2025 from 0.7% in the previous month, but missing market expectations of 0.9%, a preliminary estimate showed.

Meanwhile, the CPI with a fixed interest rate (CPIF), the Riksbank’s target measure, rose 2.8% year-on-year in July, slightly easing from a 3.0% increase in the previous month and coming in below market forecasts of a 3.0% growth.",/sweden/inflation-cpi
2025-08-07T05:59:02.31,New Zealand Stocks End Little Changed,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index ended Thursday’s session nearly flat at 12,887, as investors stayed on the sidelines amid concerns over newly imposed US tariffs. The sweeping reciprocal tariffs have now taken effect, including a higher 15% duty on New Zealand exports. Meanwhile, trade data from China — New Zealand's largest trading partner — showed exports beat forecasts in July amid a fragile tariff truce between Beijing and Washington. Domestically, labor market data released this week pointed to continued softness, reinforcing expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. On the corporate front, notable gainers included Spark NZ (+1.8%) and Chorus (+1.2%), while Contact Energy (-0.8%) and Summerset (-1.3%) were among the key decliners.",/new-zealand/stock-market

2025-08-06T23:08:05.343,New Zealand Equities Rise in Early Trade,"The NZX 50 climbed 44 points, or 0.3%, to 12,924 in early trading on Thursday, after being flat in the previous session. The gain tracked a rise in US stock futures after President Trump announced a plan to impose steep new tariffs on semiconductor imports. Wednesday's data also lifted sentiment, as the unemployment rate in New Zealand rose to its highest level since Q3 of 2020, raising hopes of interest rate cuts by the RBNZ at its upcoming meeting. However, traders were awaiting the release of trade data from China—New Zealand's top trading partner—later today, amid signs of easing trade tensions between the US and China and continued weak domestic demand. Investors also kept a close eye on US trade policy after Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods. All sectors moved into the green, led by IT, energy, and communication services. Among the early gainers were Seek (up 1.3%), Ryman Healthcare (1.2%), Scales Corp. (0.9%), FC Investment (0.8%), and ANZ Group (0.6%).",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-06T05:52:56.19,New Zealand Stocks Close Flat,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index ended flat at 12,880 on Wednesday, as investors digested the domestic jobs report. The unemployment rate edged up to a near five-year high of 5.2% in Q2, from 5.1% in Q1, but it was below the forecasted 5.3%. The data pointed to continued softness in the labor market, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand at its meeting later this month. Markets are now pricing in a 90% chance of a 25bps cut, with the potential for further easing to a floor of 2.75% later this year or early next. Meanwhile, concerns persist over the outlook for New Zealand’s export-reliant economy, which faces a higher 15% US tariff set to take effect on August 7. Among notable large-cap movers, Infratil gained 1.3% and Spark NZ added 1%, while Auckland Intl Airport lost 1.2% and Meridian Energy slipped 0.9%.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-06T03:48:39.697,Thailand Consumer Prices Fall for 4th Month,"Consumer prices in Thailand fell by 0.70% year-on-year in July 2025, a steeper decline than the expected 0.45% drop and following a 0.25% decrease in June. This marked the fourth month of deflation, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 1%–3% target range. Despite the string of negative inflation readings, the Ministry of Commerce stated there were no signs of true deflation. A key factor behind was the decline in Dubai crude oil prices, following easing tensions in the Middle East after a ceasefire agreement. Other contributing factors included government measures to reduce living costs—such as cutting electricity rates from May to August—increased supplies of fresh vegetables, and promotional campaigns by large retailers aligned with the government’s stimulus efforts. Meanwhile, core consumer prices, rose 0.84% year-on-year, the slowest pace of growth in six months, slightly below the forecasted 0.90% and easing from a 1.06% gain in June.",/thailand/inflation-cpi
2025-08-06T02:56:07.24,NZ Dollar Rises on Weaker Greenback,"The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.595, hitting a one-week high, as the US dollar continued to struggle amid higher prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Mounting concerns about the US economy—particularly signs of a cooling labor market—have bolstered bets on a September rate cut. However, the kiwi's gains may be limited by a weaker-than-expected local jobs report. While New Zealand’s unemployment rate ticked up to a near five-year high of 5.2% in Q2, it was still a little below forecasts of 5.3%. This reinforced expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could cut rates at its meeting later this month. Markets now price in a 90% chance of a 25bps cut, with the potential for further easing to a floor of 2.75% later this year or early next. Adding to concerns, the Trump administration imposed a 15% tariff on New Zealand exports, effective August 7, potentially placing further strain on the country's export-driven economy.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-08-06T01:50:44.517,"Thailand Rolls Out THB 18.5 Billion Stimulus, Pays Border Conflict Victims","Thailand will spend THB 18.5 billion on stimulus measures to boost economic competitiveness, as it prepares for the impact of new U.S. tariffs, Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat said Tuesday. The cabinet also authorized the government to draft a joint statement on trade with the U.S., though talks are still ongoing with no set signing date. The U.S. recently imposed a 19% tariff on Thai imports, lower than the earlier proposed 36% and more in line with regional peers. Julapun noted that an additional THB 25 billion remains available for tariff-related and broader relief efforts. Separately, the government approved compensation for victims of last month’s border conflict with Cambodia: THB 10 million for families of fallen officials, up to THB 1 million for injured personnel, THB 8 million for families of deceased civilians, and up to THB 800,000 for civilians wounded in the clashes.",/thailand/news

The data raised concerns about New Zealand’s economic outlook, amid additional headwinds from newly announced 15% US tariffs. The NZX 50 tracked a downbeat session on Wall Street on Tuesday amid rising trade tensions, disappointing economic data, and mixed corporate earnings. Traders also continued to monitor the US trade tariff policy after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical imports. Utilities, healthcare, consumer staples, and financials mainly dragged the index, with notable losses from Freightways (-1.2%), Westpac Banking Corporation (-1.2%), Fisher & Paykel (-0.9%), Briscoe Group (-0.7%), Ebos Group (-0.4%), and ANZ Group (-0.3%).",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-05T22:51:47.413,New Zealand Jobless Rate Rises to 5.2% in Q2,"New Zealand's unemployment rate edged up to 5.2% in the June quarter of 2025, slightly above the previous quarter's 5.1% and in line with market expectations. The number of unemployed individuals rose to 158,000, up from 156,000 in March and marking an annual increase of 16,000 people, or 11.1%. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted labour force participation rate dipped to 70.5% from 70.7% in the previous quarter, indicating a slight contraction in workforce engagement. The underutilisation rate—a broader measure of spare labour capacity—also climbed to 12.8%, up from 12.4% in March and 11.9% a year earlier. These figures suggest growing slack in the labor market, adding pressure on policymakers as economic momentum continues to soften.",/new-zealand/unemployment-rate

The fall was mainly driven by a 10.3% decline in machinery and equipment investment, largely due to a 28.6% plunge in imported transport equipment. Overall investment in imported goods dropped 13.7%, while investment in national goods fell 4.8%. Construction activity also declined, with non-residential building down 17.5%, offsetting a 9.6% rise in residential construction.

Traders also continued to brace for the US to raise tariffs on New Zealand goods from 10% to 15% starting August 7, heightening concerns about economic repercussions and putting pressure on key export sectors. Meanwhile, data showed a surprisingly strong performance in China’s services sector in July, easing concerns over Kiwi exports given the close trade relationship. Across the bourse, financial and healthcare shares led gains, with top performers including Westpac Banking (+1.1%), ANZ Group Holdings (+1.5%), and Fisher & Paykel (+2.4%).",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-05T02:22:50.947,New Zealand Dollar Declines,"The New Zealand dollar slipped to around $0.590 on Tuesday, snapping a two-day gain and moving back toward a more than two-month low, as investor focus shifted to key Q2 labor data due later this week. The market expects the unemployment rate to rise to 5.3%, the highest since Q4 2016, strengthening the case for a rate cut by the central bank at its upcoming meeting this month. Meanwhile, starting August 7, the US will raise tariffs on New Zealand goods from 10% to 15%, fueling concerns about the potential economic impact and putting pressure on key export sectors. However, economists believe the overall effect will be manageable, supported by strong commodity prices. Elsewhere, private data showed an unexpectedly strong performance in China’s services sector in July, helping ease concerns over Kiwi exports due to close trade ties. A softer US dollar also provided some support, following a weaker-than-expected US jobs report that boosted expectations for earlier rate cuts.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-08-04T23:00:59.673,New Zealand Stocks Snap 4-Day Declines,"Equities in New Zealand rose 91 points, or 0.7%, to 12,775 in morning trade on Tuesday, halting losses from the previous four sessions. The NZX 50 tracked an upbeat session on Wall Street overnight, as a weaker-than-expected jobs report raised bets on interest rate cuts happening sooner. Traders anticipated the release of New Zealand's unemployment data for Q2 later this week, with the market expecting it to rise to 5.3% — the highest since Q4 of 2016 — raising hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting this month. However, traders continued to monitor the development of US trade tariff policy and were anticipating the release of services PMI data from China, New Zealand's top trading partner, later today. Almost all sectors traded in the green, including financials, consumer discretionary, utilities, and healthcare, with notable gains from Infratil (3.7%), ANZ Group (1.9%), Mainfreight (1.5%), Skellerup (1.3%), and Fisher & Paykel (0.9%).",/new-zealand/stock-market

The improvement was driven by increased optimism about current conditions, including the household’s ability to purchase durable goods (up 2.5 points to 32), the current state of the national economy (up 0.1 to 40.8), and the household’s current financial situation (up 0.1 to 51.8).

The US is set to raise tariffs on New Zealand products from 10% to 15% effective August 7, fueling concerns over economic fallout and putting New Zealand at a disadvantage in key exports. Still, economists believe the effect will be manageable given strong commodity prices. New Zealand officials are reportedly heading to Washington following last week’s announcement. Meanwhile, adding to market caution was New Zealand’s Q2 unemployment data and upcoming trade and CPI figures from top trading partner China due later this week. Across the board, losses were led by Gentrack Group (-3.2%), Sanford (-2.9%), and Fletcher Building (-2.7%).

The gains came amid a relatively soft US dollar and as traders assessed the impact of new US tariffs. The greenback weakened last week following a disappointing US jobs report and President Donald Trump's dismissal of a top labor official, prompting markets to price in two potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, with the first expected in September. Meanwhile, the US is set to raise tariffs on New Zealand products to 15% from 10%, effective August 7, heightening concerns about the economic impact and putting New Zealand at a disadvantage in key exports.

The NZX 50 hit its lowest level since mid-July, weighed down primarily by tech, communication services, and financial stocks. Traders remained focused on the development of US tariffs, as New Zealand’s top diplomat, Vangelis Vitalis, flew to Washington following last week’s announcement that the US would impose a 15% tariff—an increase from the 10% initially threatened in April. Trade Minister Todd McClay is also expected to visit Washington in the coming days, according to local media reports. Market caution was further heightened ahead of the release of New Zealand’s Q2 jobless rate and upcoming trade and CPI data from China later this week.

2025-08-01T15:50:35.79,Mexican Peso Struggles to Recover,"The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows, despite a softer dollar chiefly reflecting domestic headwinds and tariff anxieties overwhelming the Mexican currency. July’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI remained in contraction at 49.1 for the thirteenth consecutive month, while business confidence sat below breakeven at 49.4, signaling subdued export demand and muted capital expenditure. At the same time, the looming threat of 50% steel and aluminum duties and 25% levies on autos, even after a 90-day reprieve, has stoked risk aversion toward peso assets, as market participants fear a hit to trade flows and corporate earnings.",/mexico/currency
2025-08-01T15:15:07.537,Mexico Factory Activity Contracts for 13th Month,"Mexico’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.1 in July 2025, compared to 46.3 in June, indicating a thirteenth successive deterioration but the softest contraction since January. The rise reflects a marginal easing in new orders, which firms attributed to lingering US tariffs and heightened competition from Chinese imports. Factory output also fell, albeit at the mildest pace since February, while purchasing activity declined for the seventh consecutive month as companies sought to adjust inventories amid persistent cost pressures. Employment decreased for the fifteenth month running, though at the slowest rate in the current period of job shedding. Input prices continued to climb at the steepest rate in three months, yet most producers absorbed these higher costs, with selling prices rising only marginally. Despite the ongoing downturn, sentiment improved to an eight-month high, though growth expectations remain subdued within the context of the historical series.",/mexico/manufacturing-pmi
2025-08-01T13:17:55.43,New Zealand Dollar Rebounds from 2-Month Low,"The New Zealand dollar rose above $0.59 on Friday from the two-month low of $0.586 earlier in the session, halting six session of losses as a plunge for the greenback offset fresh US tariffs on New Zealand. Payrolls in the US were revised sharply lower and the unemployment rate rose despite a lower labor force. Meanwhile, US trade levies on New Zealand were raised to 15% from the 10% baseline announced in April. The new tariff rate, set to take effect next week, has fueled concerns about the outlook for New Zealand’s export-driven economy. Additionally, consumer confidence in New Zealand dropped in July, amid expectations of rising inflation. The kiwi still fell around 2% in this week.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-08-01T12:15:56.86,Mexican Manufacturers Remain Pessimistic,"Mexico's manufacturing business confidence edged up to 49.4 in July 2025, from a downwardly revised 49.2 in June. Yet, it marked the fifth straight month the index has remained below the 50-point threshold, signaling continued pessimism in the sector. The willingness to invest showed a slight improvement, rising to 38.2 from 37.4, while the current assessment of the country’s overall situation also edged up to 48.6 from 48.5. In contrast, the current assessment of individual companies slipped to 51.1 from 51.3. Meanwhile, expectations for the company’s future outlook declined marginally to 56.6 from 56.7, and confidence in the broader domestic economy also softened slightly to 52.5 from 52.6.",/mexico/business-confidence
2025-08-01T08:11:32.273,Thailand Business Confidence at 10-Month Low,"Thailand's business confidence indicator fell to 45.8 in July 2025 from 48.6 in the previous month. The latest figure marked the lowest level since September 2024, signaling mounting concerns across several key economic areas. The performance sub-index dropped significantly to 44.3 from 49.3 in June, while production declined to 45.1 from 51.0, amid pronounced contractions in output within the plastics, food processing, and electrical appliance industries. Moreover, sentiment continued to deteriorate in employment (48.6 vs 49.6), overall order books (45.6 vs 48.0), and export conditions (44.3 vs 48.4), while investment sentiment weakened (50.6 vs 52.0). On the pricing front, output costs edged up to 44.6 from 44.4, indicating a slight cost pressures across industries. Looking ahead, the three-month forward-looking business sentiment index fell to 47.9 in July—its lowest level since August 2021—from 49.5 in the previous month.",/thailand/business-confidence
2025-08-01T07:11:56.517,Sweden Manufacturing PMI Highest in Over 3 Years,"Sweden’s Swedbank Manufacturing PMI increased to 54.2 in July 2025 from a downwardly revised 51.8 in the previous month. This marked the highest reading since May 2022 and was broadly in line with the index's historical average of 54.3. The largest positive contribution came from the sub-index for incoming orders (56.2 vs 48.8 in June), followed by suppliers' delivery times (53.1 vs 50.7) and inventory purchases (46.4 vs 47.5). However, the sub-indices for production (54.8 vs 55.6) and employment (51.7 vs 52.1) contributed negatively. Meanwhile, manufacturing companies' production plans remained optimistic, with the index rising to 63.6 from 62.8. The index for suppliers' raw and input prices edged down to 50.3 from 50.4, indicating that price pressures in the sector remain subdued. Jörgen Kennemar, responsible for the PMI analysis, warned that uncertainty surrounding global trade policy remains and lies like a wet blanket over Swedish industry with a risk of potential setbacks ahead.",/sweden/manufacturing-pmi
2025-08-01T05:54:57.123,NZX 50 Extends Losses on New US Tariffs,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index dropped 0.7% to close at 12,729 on Friday, extending losses for the third consecutive day to mark its lowest level since July 23, after President Donald Trump announced steeper tariffs against dozens of countries. New Zealand was specifically hit with a 15% base tariff rate, up from the 10% announced in April, raising concerns about the outlook for the country’s export-driven economy. In domestic news, consumer confidence in New Zealand dropped in July, amid expectations of rising inflation. Meanwhile, investors now await the US non-farm payrolls data later in the day for more clues on the Federal Reserve's rate path. Health technology stocks led the decline, with heavyweights Fisher & Paykel and Ebos Group shedding 2.2% and 2.25%, respectively. Construction materials maker Fletcher Building also lost 1.3%. Real estate stocks were also among the underperformers. For the week, the NZX 50 fell 1%, recording its second straight weekly loss.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-08-01T02:43:48.2,New Zealand Dollar Falls to 2-1/2 Month Low,"The New Zealand dollar fell to $0.587 on Friday, marking its seventh consecutive session of losses and hitting its lowest level since mid-May, after US tariffs on the country were raised to 15% from the 10% baseline announced in April. The new tariff rate, set to take effect next week, has fueled concerns about the outlook for New Zealand’s export-driven economy. Adding further downward pressure is a broadly stronger US dollar, buoyed by a hawkish Federal Reserve and continued signs of resilience in the US economy. Investors are now awaiting the release of US non-farm payrolls data later in the day for more clues on the Fed's rate path. In domestic news, consumer confidence in New Zealand dropped in July, amid expectations of rising inflation. The kiwi is down more than 2% so far this week.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-08-01T00:45:30.843,Thailand Manufacturing Sees Fastest Growth in 11 Months,"The S&P Global Thailand Manufacturing PMI rose to 51.9 in July 2025 from 51.7 in June. This marked the third consecutive month of expansion and the sharpest improvement in operating conditions in nearly a year. This reflected growing momentum in production activity and business conditions. New orders grew at the fastest pace so far this year, supported by rising client interest and stronger export demand. In response, manufacturers ramped up production and purchasing activity, leading to higher input inventories. Employment levels also picked up after stalling in June, helping reduce backlogs. Meanwhile, output price inflation eased close to neutral as input costs fell slightly, thanks to supplier discounts and bulk buying. However, stocks of finished goods dipped again amid outbound shipments. Business confidence improved to an 11-month high, with firms optimistic about future output due to marketing efforts and expansion plans.",/thailand/manufacturing-pmi
2025-07-31T23:06:20.213,New Zealand Stocks Inch Lower to Open August,"Stocks in New Zealand slipped 12 points, or 0.1%, to 12,811 on the first trading day of August, falling for the third consecutive session. Losses were led by commercial services, financials, and non-energy minerals. Sentiment was weighed down by a drop in U.S. futures after President Trump signed an executive order late Wednesday imposing new tariff rates on select trading partners, which took effect on August 1. The NZX 50 is on track for a second straight weekly loss, down about 0.3% so far, amid reports of weakening consumer sentiment driven by concerns over potential GDP and employment contractions in Q2. In China, New Zealand’s key trading partner, services activity in July grew the least in eight months, while factory output shrank for a fourth straight month. Still, losses were capped by hopes that the RBNZ may ease policy further amid subdued inflation. Notable laggards included Summerset Group (-1.4%), Colonial Motor (-1.3%), and Fletcher Building (-1.0%).",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-31T22:52:24.13,NZ  Building Permits Fall in June,"The number of building consents issued for new dwellings in New Zealand fell by 6.4% month-on-month in June 2025 to a seasonally adjusted 2,627 units. This total included 1,302 stand-alone houses, 1,169 townhouses, flats, and units, 116 apartments, and 40 retirement village units. Despite the monthly decline, the total number of new dwellings consented in the year ended June 2025 rose 1.0% to 33,979 compared to the previous year. The number of new dwellings consented per 1,000 residents remained steady at 6.4. Meanwhile, the annual value of non-residential building work consented fell 0.9% to $9.0 billion, indicating softness in the commercial construction sector.",/new-zealand/building-permits-mom
2025-07-31T22:11:56.623,NZ Consumer Confidence Drops as Recovery Stalls in July,"The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence index fell to 94.7 in July from 98.8 in June, continuing its recent volatile trend and signaling persistent economic weakness. The decline points to a sluggish recovery from last year’s recession, with weakening activity indicators and possible contractions in both GDP and employment in the June quarter. Consumer spending remains soft, as the share of households saying it’s a good time to buy a major item fell to -8, while the housing market continues to stagnate. Inflation expectations rose to 5.1%—the highest since April 2023—driven by rising costs in essentials such as food, insurance, and utilities. Perceptions of personal finances and economic conditions deteriorated further, weighing on future sentiment. However, easing mortgage rates and strong farm incomes may offer some support in the coming months, potentially paving the way for RBNZ rate cuts to aid the recovery.",/new-zealand/anz-roy-morgan-consumer-confidence-index
2025-07-31T08:13:28.833,Thailand Retail Sales Growth Slows,"Retail sales in Thailand rose by 26.1% year-on-year in May 2025, slowing from a 41.9% growth in the previous month. Sales increased at a softer pace for non-durable goods (1.7% vs 3.8% in April) and other goods (57.1% vs 89.3%). At the same time, sales declined for durable goods (-2.1% vs 0.6%) and motor vehicles and automotive fuel (-1.2% vs 0.7%). Meanwhile, sales in department stores, supermarkets and general stores rose further (21.7% vs 14%).

2025-07-31T07:54:22.383,Thailand Current Account Surplus Widens in June,"Thailand’s current account recorded a surplus of USD 2.4 billion in June 2025, widening from USD 1.7 billion in the same month of the previous year. The increase was mainly driven by a higher trade balance, which grew to USD 3.3 billion from USD 2.4 billion a year ago, with exports rising 16.1%, while imports increasing at a softer pace of 13.8%. Meanwhile, net deficit in services, primary income, and secondary income expanded to USD 0.9 billion from USD 0.8 billion in June last year.",/thailand/current-account
2025-07-31T07:41:35.82,Thailand Private Investment Recovers in June,"Private investment in Thailand rose by 0.7% month-on-month in June 2025, rebounding from a 0.6% decline in the previous month. The recovery was driven by a pickup in machinery and equipment investment, supported by higher domestic machinery sales and increased production of electrical equipment. Vehicle investment remained stable, as stronger imports of ships and increased registrations of pickup trucks offset declines in passenger car and truck registrations. Meanwhile, construction investment was broadly unchanged. Non-residential construction rose across all components, particularly in areas permitted for factory construction, while residential construction weakened, as reflected by a decline in permitted areas for single houses and townhouses.",/thailand/private-investment
2025-07-31T07:38:42.443,Thailand Personal Spending Falls in June,"Private consumption in Thailand fell by 0.3% month-on-month in June 2025, reversing a 0.2% gain in the previous month. Several spending categories declined, with services consumption down mainly due to reduced foreign tourist spending, although domestic tourism continued to grow. Spending on non-durable goods also weakened, dragged down by lower sales of fuel, consumer products, and alcoholic beverages. Durable goods consumption declined following a surge in car deliveries earlier in the year. In contrast, semi-durable goods saw modest gains, supported by higher imports of textiles and apparel. Consumer confidence continued to deteriorate amid growing concerns over US trade policy, weak demand recovery, and elevated household debt.",/thailand/personal-spending
2025-07-31T05:52:45.887,New Zealand Stocks Fall for 2nd Day,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index closed 0.25% lower at 12,824 on Thursday, marking its second consecutive session of losses. The local market mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where most US equities slipped after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again and gave no signal it plans to lower rates in September, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump. Further weighing on investor sentiment was the looming August 1 tariff deadline set by Trump, with several countries—including New Zealand—yet to clinch a deal. Moreover, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China raised fresh concerns over the economic outlook for New Zealand’s largest trading partner. On the corporate front, notable decliners included index heavyweights Auckland International Airport (-1.2%), Infratil (-3.1%), Mainfreight (-1.3%), Mercury NZ (-1.0%), and Spark NZ (-0.6%). The NZX 50 still posted a 1.75% gain in July, logging its third straight monthly rise.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-31T03:42:16.033,NZ Dollar Edges Up but Remains Vulnerable,"The New Zealand dollar edged up to around $0.591 on Thursday after sliding 1% overnight that marked its fifth consecutive session of declines. Despite the modest rebound, the kiwi remains under pressure due to broad US dollar strength, which extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to ease policy, and indicated that no decision had been made regarding a widely anticipated cut in September. Investors also remained cautious as Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline is around the corner and several countries—including New Zealand—have yet to strike a deal. Adding further pressure, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China stoked fresh concerns over the health of its economy. Given that China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, any signs of Chinese economic weakness typically weigh on the kiwi. The New Zealand dollar is heading for a monthly loss of nearly 3%, on track to break a four-month streak of gains.",/new-zealand/currency
2025-07-30T23:05:32.133,New Zealand Equities Poised for Third Straight Monthly Gain,"The NZX 50 was little changed at around 12,860 on Thursday morning, after closing lower in the prior session, as strength in commercial services and consumer durables was offset by weakness in logistics and non-energy minerals. Traders digested the U.S. Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, though two governors dissented—the first double dissent since 1993. Locally, New Zealand’s business sentiment rose to a three-month high in July, on easing inflation expectations and a tight labor market. The benchmark index remains on track for a third consecutive monthly gain, up about 2% so far, amid optimism after the U.S. and China agreed to explore an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplaying concerns that President Trump might reject the deal. Top gainers included Winton Land (4.0%), South Port NZ (2.35%), and Freightways Group (1.7%), while Fletcher Building (-1.6%), Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (-0.7%), and Mercury NZ (-0.6%) fell.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-30T13:26:53.43,Mexican Peso Slips to 1-Month Low on Strong USD,"The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows as a broad rebound in the US dollar, further supported by a 3% annualized GDP surge in Q2, dovetailing with high-profile US–EU and US–Japan trade agreements that capped tariff-war fears, overwhelmed Mexico’s otherwise robust economic backdrop. As expected, the Fed held rates at 4.25%–4.50%, revised down its H1 growth outlook to “moderation” from “solid pace,” and, for the first time since 1993, saw two governors dissent in favor of a September rate cut. Back home, Mexico’s economy expanded 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in Q2, its strongest pace since late 2024 and well ahead of the 0.4% consensus, just as unemployment fell to 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, underscoring a tight labor market. Banxico’s high interest rate, and the expectation it will stay that way, keeps real yields attractive for carry-trade investors. While these inflows provide some support, they’ve only partly cushioned the peso from the dollar’s strength.",/mexico/currency
2025-07-30T12:09:59.143,Mexican GDP Grows More than Expected,"The Mexican GDP expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% from the previous quarter in the second quarter of 2025, well above market expectations of a 0.4% increase, to mark the sharpest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2024. Growth was carried by the services sector (0.7% vs -0.1% in Q1) and manufacturing (0.8% vs -0.%), which offset the 1.3% plunge for primary industries, trimming surges of over 6.5% in the two previous quarters. From the previous year, the Mexican GDP expanded by a softer 0.1%.",/mexico/gdp-growth
2025-07-30T08:07:17.87,Thailand Industrial Output Growth Below Forecasts,"Thailand’s industrial production rose by 0.58% yoy in June 2025, significantly below expectations of 2.0% growth, and down from an upwardly revised 1.94% increase in May. While this marked the fourth consecutive month of expansion, it was the softest growth since March. The upturn was driven by strong growth in output from automotive manufacturing (17.02%), clothing and apparel (11.84%), electronic components and circuit boards (6.18%), and computer and peripherals (2.00%). By contrast, output fell in food products (-0.22%), basic iron and steel (-0.58%), rubber and plastic products (-0.81%), and petroleum refining (-3.15%). On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, industrial production contracted by 1.71% in June, following a revised 0.16% drop in May. In April, the Industry Ministry lowered its 2025 industrial growth forecast to a range of 0%–1%, down from an earlier projection of 1.5%–2.5%, citing uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and elevated household debt as key headwinds.",/thailand/industrial-production
2025-07-30T08:05:23.71,Sweden Consumer Confidence at 5-Month High,"Sweden's consumer confidence indicator jumped to 90.7 in July 2025 from an upwardly revised 84.9 in the previous month, marking the highest reading since February. The upturn was broad-based, with all sub-indices posting increases. Notably, sentiment regarding households’ own financial situation strengthened significantly—both in terms of developments over the past twelve months and expectations for the year ahead.",/sweden/consumer-confidence
2025-07-30T07:25:03.787,Sweden Economic Tendency Indicator Rises in July,"The Economic Tendency Indicator for Sweden rose to 94.3 in July 2025, from a fifteen-month low of 92.7 in June. Consumer confidence saw a sharp increase, climbing to 90.7 from 84.9 in June—the second-largest monthly increase since the series began in 1996—with improvements across all sub-components. Despite this positive development among consumers, it remains the sector with the weakest sentiment overall. At the same time, business sentiment improved (97 vs 95 in June), particularly in the retail (102.1 vs 98.2) and services (96.4 vs 93.3) sectors. However, confidence weakened in the manufacturing (96.3 vs 98.7) and construction (97.7 vs 98.6) sectors.",/sweden/leading-economic-index
2025-07-30T06:22:35.473,Sweden Retail Sales Rebound in June,"Retail sales in Sweden rose by 2.5% year-on-year in June 2025, rebounding from an upwardly revised 1.9% decline in the previous month. The recovery was largely driven by a sharp increase in durable goods sales, which rose 5.3% after falling 1.5% in May. In contrast, sales of consumables continued to decline, down 1.1% following a 1.4% drop previously. On a monthly basis, retail sales grew by 2.4%, sharply recovering from a downwardly revised 4.6% fall in May and marking the strongest monthly gain since December 2024. Over the April–June period, retail sales decreased by 0.6% compared to the preceding three-month period (January–March).",/sweden/retail-sales-annual

Investors turned cautious after US-China trade talks concluded without any major breakthroughs. Although both sides agreed to seek an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, the final decision is up to President Trump. Adding to concerns, New Zealand—currently subject to Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs—could face higher levies of 15% to 20% if a deal isn't reached soon. Meanwhile, expectations that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates steady this week also contributed to the cautious mood. On the domestic front, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum. In corporate news, Mainfreight was the session’s biggest drag, plunging 9.6% after the logistics company reported a slow and disappointing start to FY2026, with profits down across its three main divisions.",/new-zealand/stock-market
2025-07-30T03:51:57.623,NZ Dollar Rebounds as US Dollar Softens,"The New Zealand dollar rose to around $0.596 on Wednesday, ending a four-day losing streak, supported by a weaker US dollar. The greenback retreated as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision. While the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady, investors will be watching closely for any hints of a potential rate cut in September. On the trade front, the US and China concluded two days of talks described by both sides as “constructive,” agreeing to continue working to extend their 90-day tariff truce. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that any extension would ultimately depend on President Donald Trump, leaving a degree of uncertainty in the outlook. In domestic news, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum.",/new-zealand/currency

The improvement was supported by a lift in past own activity (5.9 vs 2.3 in June), though forward-looking activity was little changed (40.6 vs 40.9). Export intentions edged up (14.6 vs 13.9), and employment intentions also improved (11.8 vs 10.8), while investment intentions held steady (19.7 vs 19.9). Pricing intentions fell to their lowest since December 2024, amid easing inflation expectations (2.68% vs 2.71%). Cost expectations dipped but remained high (75.9 vs 79.0), while wage expectations rose (79.1 vs 76.1), pointing to lingering labor market tightness. Credit availability remained broadly stable (15.0 vs 15.9). However, residential construction slumped sharply to a one-year low (16.7 vs 44.8), contrasting with continued strength in commercial construction (28.9 vs 28.1), which stayed positive for a 13th straight month.",/new-zealand/business-confidence
