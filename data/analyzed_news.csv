2025-08-06T03:48:39.697,Thailand Consumer Prices Fall for 4th Month,"Consumer prices in Thailand fell by 0.70% year-on-year in July 2025, a steeper decline than the expected 0.45% drop and following a 0.25% decrease in June. This marked the fourth month of deflation, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 1%–3% target range. Despite the string of negative inflation readings, the Ministry of Commerce stated there were no signs of true deflation. A key factor behind was the decline in Dubai crude oil prices, following easing tensions in the Middle East after a ceasefire agreement. Other contributing factors included government measures to reduce living costs—such as cutting electricity rates from May to August—increased supplies of fresh vegetables, and promotional campaigns by large retailers aligned with the government’s stimulus efforts. Meanwhile, core consumer prices, rose 0.84% year-on-year, the slowest pace of growth in six months, slightly below the forecasted 0.90% and easing from a 1.06% gain in June.",/thailand/inflation-cpi,True,low
2025-08-06T02:56:07.24,NZ Dollar Rises on Weaker Greenback,"The New Zealand dollar rose to $0.592 on Wednesday, moving further away from multi-week lows, as the US dollar continued to struggle amid higher prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Mounting concerns about the US economy—particularly signs of a cooling labor market—have bolstered bets on a September rate cut. However, the kiwi's gains may be limited by a weaker-than-expected local jobs report. While New Zealand’s unemployment rate ticked up to a near five-year high of 5.2% in Q2, it was still a little below forecasts of 5.3%. This reinforced expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could cut rates at its next meeting in August. Markets now price in a 90% chance of a 25bps cut, with the potential for further easing to a floor of 2.75% later this year or early next. Adding to concerns, the Trump administration imposed a 15% tariff on New Zealand exports, effective August 7, potentially placing further strain on the country's export-driven economy.",/new-zealand/currency,False,
2025-08-06T01:50:44.517,"Thailand Rolls Out THB 18.5 Billion Stimulus, Pays Border Conflict Victims","Thailand will spend THB 18.5 billion on stimulus measures to boost economic competitiveness, as it prepares for the impact of new U.S. tariffs, Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat said Tuesday. The cabinet also authorized the government to draft a joint statement on trade with the U.S., though talks are still ongoing with no set signing date. The U.S. recently imposed a 19% tariff on Thai imports, lower than the earlier proposed 36% and more in line with regional peers. Julapun noted that an additional THB 25 billion remains available for tariff-related and broader relief efforts. Separately, the government approved compensation for victims of last month’s border conflict with Cambodia: THB 10 million for families of fallen officials, up to THB 1 million for injured personnel, THB 8 million for families of deceased civilians, and up to THB 800,000 for civilians wounded in the clashes.",/thailand/news,False,
2025-08-05T22:51:47.413,New Zealand Jobless Rate Rises to 5.2% in Q2,"New Zealand's unemployment rate edged up to 5.2% in the June quarter of 2025, slightly above the previous quarter's 5.1% and in line with market expectations. The number of unemployed individuals rose to 158,000, up from 156,000 in March and marking an annual increase of 16,000 people, or 11.1%. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted labour force participation rate dipped to 70.5% from 70.7% in the previous quarter, indicating a slight contraction in workforce engagement. The underutilisation rate—a broader measure of spare labour capacity—also climbed to 12.8%, up from 12.4% in March and 11.9% a year earlier. These figures suggest growing slack in the labor market, adding pressure on policymakers as economic momentum continues to soften.",/new-zealand/unemployment-rate,False,
2025-08-05T13:10:39.76,Mexico Gross Fixed Investment Drops for 9th Month,"Gross fixed investment in Mexico declined 7.1% year-on-year in May 2025, marking the ninth consecutive contraction, though improving from the 12.5% drop in April. The fall was mainly driven by a 10.3% decline in machinery and equipment investment, largely due to a 28.6% plunge in imported transport equipment. Overall investment in imported goods dropped 13.7%, while investment in national goods fell 4.8%. Construction activity also declined, with non-residential building down 17.5%, offsetting a 9.6% rise in residential construction. Public investment plunged 25.8%, and private investment decreased 4.9%. On a seasonally adjusted basis, gross fixed investment rose 0.9%, rebounding from a 1.6% drop in April.",/mexico/private-investment,False,
2025-08-01T15:50:35.79,Mexican Peso Struggles to Recover,"The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows, despite a softer dollar chiefly reflecting domestic headwinds and tariff anxieties overwhelming the Mexican currency. July’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI remained in contraction at 49.1 for the thirteenth consecutive month, while business confidence sat below breakeven at 49.4, signaling subdued export demand and muted capital expenditure. At the same time, the looming threat of 50% steel and aluminum duties and 25% levies on autos, even after a 90-day reprieve, has stoked risk aversion toward peso assets, as market participants fear a hit to trade flows and corporate earnings.",/mexico/currency,False,
2025-08-01T15:15:07.537,Mexico Factory Activity Contracts for 13th Month,"Mexico’s S&P Global Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.1 in July 2025, compared to 46.3 in June, indicating a thirteenth successive deterioration but the softest contraction since January. The rise reflects a marginal easing in new orders, which firms attributed to lingering US tariffs and heightened competition from Chinese imports. Factory output also fell, albeit at the mildest pace since February, while purchasing activity declined for the seventh consecutive month as companies sought to adjust inventories amid persistent cost pressures. Employment decreased for the fifteenth month running, though at the slowest rate in the current period of job shedding. Input prices continued to climb at the steepest rate in three months, yet most producers absorbed these higher costs, with selling prices rising only marginally. Despite the ongoing downturn, sentiment improved to an eight-month high, though growth expectations remain subdued within the context of the historical series.",/mexico/manufacturing-pmi,False,
2025-08-01T08:11:32.273,Thailand Business Confidence at 10-Month Low,"Thailand's business confidence indicator fell to 45.8 in July 2025 from 48.6 in the previous month. The latest figure marked the lowest level since September 2024, signaling mounting concerns across several key economic areas. The performance sub-index dropped significantly to 44.3 from 49.3 in June, while production declined to 45.1 from 51.0, amid pronounced contractions in output within the plastics, food processing, and electrical appliance industries. Moreover, sentiment continued to deteriorate in employment (48.6 vs 49.6), overall order books (45.6 vs 48.0), and export conditions (44.3 vs 48.4), while investment sentiment weakened (50.6 vs 52.0).

2025-07-31T23:06:20.213,New Zealand Stocks Inch Lower to Open August,"Stocks in New Zealand slipped 12 points, or 0.1%, to 12,811 on the first trading day of August, falling for the third consecutive session. Losses were led by commercial services, financials, and non-energy minerals. Sentiment was weighed down by a drop in U.S. futures after President Trump signed an executive order late Wednesday imposing new tariff rates on select trading partners, which took effect on August 1. The NZX 50 is on track for a second straight weekly loss, down about 0.3% so far, amid reports of weakening consumer sentiment driven by concerns over potential GDP and employment contractions in Q2. In China, New Zealand’s key trading partner, services activity in July grew the least in eight months, while factory output shrank for a fourth straight month. Still, losses were capped by hopes that the RBNZ may ease policy further amid subdued inflation. Notable laggards included Summerset Group (-1.4%), Colonial Motor (-1.3%), and Fletcher Building (-1.0%).",/new-zealand/stock-market,False,
2025-07-31T22:11:56.623,NZ Consumer Confidence Drops as Recovery Stalls in July,"The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence index fell to 94.7 in July from 98.8 in June, continuing its recent volatile trend and signaling persistent economic weakness. The decline points to a sluggish recovery from last year’s recession, with weakening activity indicators and possible contractions in both GDP and employment in the June quarter. Consumer spending remains soft, as the share of households saying it’s a good time to buy a major item fell to -8, while the housing market continues to stagnate. Inflation expectations rose to 5.1%—the highest since April 2023—driven by rising costs in essentials such as food, insurance, and utilities. Perceptions of personal finances and economic conditions deteriorated further, weighing on future sentiment. However, easing mortgage rates and strong farm incomes may offer some support in the coming months, potentially paving the way for RBNZ rate cuts to aid the recovery.",/new-zealand/anz-roy-morgan-consumer-confidence-index,False,
2025-07-31T05:52:45.887,New Zealand Stocks Fall for 2nd Day,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index closed 0.25% lower at 12,824 on Thursday, marking its second consecutive session of losses. The local market mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where most US equities slipped after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again and gave no signal it plans to lower rates in September, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump. Further weighing on investor sentiment was the looming August 1 tariff deadline set by Trump, with several countries—including New Zealand—yet to clinch a deal. Moreover, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China raised fresh concerns over the economic outlook for New Zealand’s largest trading partner. On the corporate front, notable decliners included index heavyweights Auckland International Airport (-1.2%), Infratil (-3.1%), Mainfreight (-1.3%), Mercury NZ (-1.0%), and Spark NZ (-0.6%). The NZX 50 still posted a 1.75% gain in July, logging its third straight monthly rise.",/new-zealand/stock-market,True,low
2025-07-31T03:42:16.033,NZ Dollar Edges Up but Remains Vulnerable,"The New Zealand dollar edged up to around $0.591 on Thursday after sliding 1% overnight that marked its fifth consecutive session of declines. Despite the modest rebound, the kiwi remains under pressure due to broad US dollar strength, which extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to ease policy, and indicated that no decision had been made regarding a widely anticipated cut in September. Investors also remained cautious as Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline is around the corner and several countries—including New Zealand—have yet to strike a deal. Adding further pressure, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China stoked fresh concerns over the health of its economy. Given that China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, any signs of Chinese economic weakness typically weigh on the kiwi. The New Zealand dollar is heading for a monthly loss of nearly 3%, on track to break a four-month streak of gains.",/new-zealand/currency,True,low
2025-07-30T23:05:32.133,New Zealand Equities Poised for Third Straight Monthly Gain,"The NZX 50 was little changed at around 12,860 on Thursday morning, after closing lower in the prior session, as strength in commercial services and consumer durables was offset by weakness in logistics and non-energy minerals. Traders digested the U.S. Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, though two governors dissented—the first double dissent since 1993. Locally, New Zealand’s business sentiment rose to a three-month high in July, on easing inflation expectations and a tight labor market. The benchmark index remains on track for a third consecutive monthly gain, up about 2% so far, amid optimism after the U.S. and China agreed to explore an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplaying concerns that President Trump might reject the deal. Top gainers included Winton Land (4.0%), South Port NZ (2.35%), and Freightways Group (1.7%), while Fletcher Building (-1.6%), Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (-0.7%), and Mercury NZ (-0.6%) fell.",/new-zealand/stock-market,True,low
2025-07-30T13:26:53.43,Mexican Peso Slips to 1-Month Low on Strong USD,"The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows as a broad rebound in the US dollar, further supported by a 3% annualized GDP surge in Q2, dovetailing with high-profile US–EU and US–Japan trade agreements that capped tariff-war fears, overwhelmed Mexico’s otherwise robust economic backdrop. As expected, the Fed held rates at 4.25%–4.50%, revised down its H1 growth outlook to “moderation” from “solid pace,” and, for the first time since 1993, saw two governors dissent in favor of a September rate cut. Back home, Mexico’s economy expanded 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in Q2, its strongest pace since late 2024 and well ahead of the 0.4% consensus, just as unemployment fell to 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, underscoring a tight labor market. Banxico’s high interest rate, and the expectation it will stay that way, keeps real yields attractive for carry-trade investors. While these inflows provide some support, they’ve only partly cushioned the peso from the dollar’s strength.",/mexico/currency,True,low
2025-07-30T08:07:17.87,Thailand Industrial Output Growth Below Forecasts,"Thailand’s industrial production rose by 0.58% yoy in June 2025, significantly below expectations of 2.0% growth, and down from an upwardly revised 1.94% increase in May. While this marked the fourth consecutive month of expansion, it was the softest growth since March. The upturn was driven by strong growth in output from automotive manufacturing (17.02%), clothing and apparel (11.84%), electronic components and circuit boards (6.18%), and computer and peripherals (2.00%). By contrast, output fell in food products (-0.22%), basic iron and steel (-0.58%), rubber and plastic products (-0.81%), and petroleum refining (-3.15%). On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, industrial production contracted by 1.71% in June, following a revised 0.16% drop in May. In April, the Industry Ministry lowered its 2025 industrial growth forecast to a range of 0%–1%, down from an earlier projection of 1.5%–2.5%, citing uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and elevated household debt as key headwinds.",/thailand/industrial-production,False,
2025-07-30T06:09:51.067,New Zealand Stocks Snap 4-day Win Streak,"The S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.6% to close at 12,856 on Wednesday, snapping a four-day run of gains. Investors turned cautious after US-China trade talks concluded without any major breakthroughs. Although both sides agreed to seek an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, the final decision is up to President Trump. Adding to concerns, New Zealand—currently subject to Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs—could face higher levies of 15% to 20% if a deal isn't reached soon. Meanwhile, expectations that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates steady this week also contributed to the cautious mood. On the domestic front, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum. In corporate news, Mainfreight was the session’s biggest drag, plunging 9.6% after the logistics company reported a slow and disappointing start to FY2026, with profits down across its three main divisions.",/new-zealand/stock-market,True,low
2025-07-29T23:08:57.323,New Zealand Shares Subdued,"New Zealand stocks were little changed in Wednesday morning trade, hovering around 12,930 after four straight sessions of gains. Strength in commercial services and utilities offset losses in industrial services and consumer non-durables. Investors cautiously awaited July’s business sentiment data, due later today, after June marked the first rise since February. In Australia, key monthly and quarterly inflation reports are scheduled for release later today. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended a six-day rally Tuesday as traders digested a wave of corporate earnings and closely tracked U.S.-China trade negotiations. Attention also turned to the Fed’s rate decision due later today, with President Trump renewing calls for rate cuts. U.S. inflation data later in the week added to the cautious mood. Colonial Motor Co. fell 2.1%, followed by Restaurant Brands NZ (-2.0%), and T&G Global (-1.8%).

2025-07-29T14:28:55.813,Mexican Peso at 1-Month Low,"The Mexican peso weakened past 18.8 per USD, reaching one-month lows as a resurgent US dollar, buoyed by a string of trade breakthroughs, including headline 15% tariffs under the new US–EU and US–Japan pacts, has lifted expectations for stronger US growth and a steadfast Federal Reserve. Domestically, a sharply narrowed June merchandise surplus and softer industrial output compounded concerns that Mexico’s export engines are losing steam just as looming US tariff deadlines inject fresh uncertainty. However, the peso’s losses have been capped by Mexico’s exceptionally tight labor market, unemployment came at 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, alongside still-elevated Banxico rates underpinned by sticky core inflation, which together sustain higher real yields and attract carry-trade inflows.",/mexico/currency,False,

Mattias Kain Wyatt, an economist at Statistics Sweden, said that after a decline in May, economic activity saw an upturn in June, contributing to modest overall growth for the quarter.

Investors are now awaiting the outcome of trade talks between top US and Chinese officials, with expectations for another 90-day extension of the current tariff pause. This follows a recent agreement between the US and EU, which includes a 15% tariff on most European goods. Market participants are also closely watching the US Federal Reserve policy meeting this week, where the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged.

Meanwhile, acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said Bangkok expects the Trump administration to offer a “very good” trade deal, following an agreement to end an armed border conflict with Cambodia under a U.S.-brokered peace initiative. The U.S. was Thailand’s largest export market in 2024, accounting for 18.3% of total exports, or USD 54.96 billion, while the U.S. trade deficit with Thailand stood at $45.6 billion. Pichai added that Thailand’s proposal remains unchanged. He noted that tariffs could be announced on August 1 or 2.",/thailand/balance-of-trade,True,low
2025-07-29T02:26:34.53,New Zealand Dollar Falls on Greenback Strength,"The New Zealand dollar fell to around $0.595 on Tuesday, extending its decline for a fourth straight session and hitting a one-week low, weighed down by a stronger US dollar. The greenback advanced following the US-EU trade agreement, which is seen to be more favorable to the US. The kiwi was further pressured by concerns that New Zealand, one of the countries currently subject to Trump's 10% baseline tariffs, could face increased levies of 15% to 20% if it doesn't secure a separate deal soon. Meanwhile, investors are watching the ongoing US-China trade talks, amid expectations of another 90-day extension to the truce between the world’s two largest economies.

Separately, the U.S. and China resumed talks, with bets growing for a 90-day extension to their tariff truce. Meanwhile, President Trump said the baseline global tariff rate will likely fall “in the range of 15 to 20%.” At the same time, hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady this week encouraged market participants to add new positions.
