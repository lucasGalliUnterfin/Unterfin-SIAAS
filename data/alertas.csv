2025-08-06T03:48:39.697,Thailand Consumer Prices Fall for 4th Month,"Consumer prices in Thailand fell by 0.70% year-on-year in July 2025, a steeper decline than the expected 0.45% drop and following a 0.25% decrease in June. This marked the fourth month of deflation, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 1%–3% target range. Despite the string of negative inflation readings, the Ministry of Commerce stated there were no signs of true deflation. A key factor behind was the decline in Dubai crude oil prices, following easing tensions in the Middle East after a ceasefire agreement. Other contributing factors included government measures to reduce living costs—such as cutting electricity rates from May to August—increased supplies of fresh vegetables, and promotional campaigns by large retailers aligned with the government’s stimulus efforts. Meanwhile, core consumer prices, rose 0.84% year-on-year, the slowest pace of growth in six months, slightly below the forecasted 0.90% and easing from a 1.06% gain in June.",/thailand/inflation-cpi,3
2025-08-04T05:53:54.85,New Zealand Stocks Close at Nearly 4-Week Low,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.4% to 12,684 on Monday, marking its fourth straight decline and closing at its lowest level in nearly four weeks, as investors focused on the impact of fresh US tariffs. The US is set to raise tariffs on New Zealand products from 10% to 15% effective August 7, fueling concerns over economic fallout and putting New Zealand at a disadvantage in key exports. Still, economists believe the effect will be manageable given strong commodity prices. New Zealand officials are reportedly heading to Washington following last week’s announcement. Meanwhile, adding to market caution was New Zealand’s Q2 unemployment data and upcoming trade and CPI figures from top trading partner China due later this week. Across the board, losses were led by Gentrack Group (-3.2%), Sanford (-2.9%), and Fletcher Building (-2.7%). Shares in consumer and distribution services also declined, with Vulcan Steel down 2% and SkyCity off 1%.",/new-zealand/stock-market,3
2025-07-31T03:42:16.033,NZ Dollar Edges Up but Remains Vulnerable,"The New Zealand dollar edged up to around $0.591 on Thursday after sliding 1% overnight that marked its fifth consecutive session of declines. Despite the modest rebound, the kiwi remains under pressure due to broad US dollar strength, which extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to ease policy, and indicated that no decision had been made regarding a widely anticipated cut in September. Investors also remained cautious as Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline is around the corner and several countries—including New Zealand—have yet to strike a deal. Adding further pressure, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China stoked fresh concerns over the health of its economy. Given that China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, any signs of Chinese economic weakness typically weigh on the kiwi. The New Zealand dollar is heading for a monthly loss of nearly 3%, on track to break a four-month streak of gains.",/new-zealand/currency,3
