2025-08-06T03:48:39.697,Thailand Consumer Prices Fall for 4th Month,"Consumer prices in Thailand fell by 0.70% year-on-year in July 2025, a steeper decline than the expected 0.45% drop and following a 0.25% decrease in June. This marked the fourth month of deflation, keeping inflation below the central bank’s 1%–3% target range. Despite the string of negative inflation readings, the Ministry of Commerce stated there were no signs of true deflation. A key factor behind was the decline in Dubai crude oil prices, following easing tensions in the Middle East after a ceasefire agreement. Other contributing factors included government measures to reduce living costs—such as cutting electricity rates from May to August—increased supplies of fresh vegetables, and promotional campaigns by large retailers aligned with the government’s stimulus efforts. Meanwhile, core consumer prices, rose 0.84% year-on-year, the slowest pace of growth in six months, slightly below the forecasted 0.90% and easing from a 1.06% gain in June.",/thailand/inflation-cpi,verde
2025-08-04T05:53:54.85,New Zealand Stocks Close at Nearly 4-Week Low,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.4% to 12,684 on Monday, marking its fourth straight decline and closing at its lowest level in nearly four weeks, as investors focused on the impact of fresh US tariffs. The US is set to raise tariffs on New Zealand products from 10% to 15% effective August 7, fueling concerns over economic fallout and putting New Zealand at a disadvantage in key exports. Still, economists believe the effect will be manageable given strong commodity prices. New Zealand officials are reportedly heading to Washington following last week’s announcement. Meanwhile, adding to market caution was New Zealand’s Q2 unemployment data and upcoming trade and CPI figures from top trading partner China due later this week. Across the board, losses were led by Gentrack Group (-3.2%), Sanford (-2.9%), and Fletcher Building (-2.7%). Shares in consumer and distribution services also declined, with Vulcan Steel down 2% and SkyCity off 1%.",/new-zealand/stock-market,verde
2025-08-03T23:06:04.507,New Zealand Stocks Kick off Week Lower,"New Zealand’s stocks fell 16 points, or 0.1%, to 12,714 in morning trade on Monday, down for the fourth straight session, tracking a sharp selloff on Wall Street on Friday, driven by weak July jobs data and a new tariff policy announced by US President Trump. The NZX 50 hit its lowest level since mid-July, weighed down primarily by tech, communication services, and financial stocks. Traders remained focused on the development of US tariffs, as New Zealand’s top diplomat, Vangelis Vitalis, flew to Washington following last week’s announcement that the US would impose a 15% tariff—an increase from the 10% initially threatened in April. Trade Minister Todd McClay is also expected to visit Washington in the coming days, according to local media reports. Market caution was further heightened ahead of the release of New Zealand’s Q2 jobless rate and upcoming trade and CPI data from China later this week. Among early losers were Gentrack Group (-1.5%), Infratil (-0.7%), and ANZ Group (-0.6%).",/new-zealand/stock-market,verde
2025-07-31T05:52:45.887,New Zealand Stocks Fall for 2nd Day,"New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index closed 0.25% lower at 12,824 on Thursday, marking its second consecutive session of losses. The local market mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where most US equities slipped after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady again and gave no signal it plans to lower rates in September, despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump. Further weighing on investor sentiment was the looming August 1 tariff deadline set by Trump, with several countries—including New Zealand—yet to clinch a deal. Moreover, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China raised fresh concerns over the economic outlook for New Zealand’s largest trading partner. On the corporate front, notable decliners included index heavyweights Auckland International Airport (-1.2%), Infratil (-3.1%), Mainfreight (-1.3%), Mercury NZ (-1.0%), and Spark NZ (-0.6%). The NZX 50 still posted a 1.75% gain in July, logging its third straight monthly rise.",/new-zealand/stock-market,verde
2025-07-31T03:42:16.033,NZ Dollar Edges Up but Remains Vulnerable,"The New Zealand dollar edged up to around $0.591 on Thursday after sliding 1% overnight that marked its fifth consecutive session of declines. Despite the modest rebound, the kiwi remains under pressure due to broad US dollar strength, which extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from President Donald Trump to ease policy, and indicated that no decision had been made regarding a widely anticipated cut in September. Investors also remained cautious as Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline is around the corner and several countries—including New Zealand—have yet to strike a deal. Adding further pressure, weaker-than-expected PMI data from China stoked fresh concerns over the health of its economy. Given that China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, any signs of Chinese economic weakness typically weigh on the kiwi. The New Zealand dollar is heading for a monthly loss of nearly 3%, on track to break a four-month streak of gains.",/new-zealand/currency,verde
2025-07-30T23:05:32.133,New Zealand Equities Poised for Third Straight Monthly Gain,"The NZX 50 was little changed at around 12,860 on Thursday morning, after closing lower in the prior session, as strength in commercial services and consumer durables was offset by weakness in logistics and non-energy minerals. Traders digested the U.S. Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, though two governors dissented—the first double dissent since 1993. Locally, New Zealand’s business sentiment rose to a three-month high in July, on easing inflation expectations and a tight labor market. The benchmark index remains on track for a third consecutive monthly gain, up about 2% so far, amid optimism after the U.S. and China agreed to explore an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplaying concerns that President Trump might reject the deal. Top gainers included Winton Land (4.0%), South Port NZ (2.35%), and Freightways Group (1.7%), while Fletcher Building (-1.6%), Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (-0.7%), and Mercury NZ (-0.6%) fell.",/new-zealand/stock-market,verde
2025-07-30T13:26:53.43,Mexican Peso Slips to 1-Month Low on Strong USD,"The Mexican peso slid past 18.80 per USD to one-month lows as a broad rebound in the US dollar, further supported by a 3% annualized GDP surge in Q2, dovetailing with high-profile US–EU and US–Japan trade agreements that capped tariff-war fears, overwhelmed Mexico’s otherwise robust economic backdrop. As expected, the Fed held rates at 4.25%–4.50%, revised down its H1 growth outlook to “moderation” from “solid pace,” and, for the first time since 1993, saw two governors dissent in favor of a September rate cut. Back home, Mexico’s economy expanded 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in Q2, its strongest pace since late 2024 and well ahead of the 0.4% consensus, just as unemployment fell to 2.7% in June, the lowest since 2002, underscoring a tight labor market. Banxico’s high interest rate, and the expectation it will stay that way, keeps real yields attractive for carry-trade investors. While these inflows provide some support, they’ve only partly cushioned the peso from the dollar’s strength.",/mexico/currency,verde
2025-07-30T06:09:51.067,New Zealand Stocks Snap 4-day Win Streak,"The S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.6% to close at 12,856 on Wednesday, snapping a four-day run of gains. Investors turned cautious after US-China trade talks concluded without any major breakthroughs. Although both sides agreed to seek an extension of their 90-day tariff truce, the final decision is up to President Trump. Adding to concerns, New Zealand—currently subject to Trump’s 10% baseline tariffs—could face higher levies of 15% to 20% if a deal isn't reached soon. Meanwhile, expectations that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates steady this week also contributed to the cautious mood. On the domestic front, New Zealand’s business confidence improved further in July, but conditions remain challenging for many firms, with forward-looking activity indicators showing little momentum. In corporate news, Mainfreight was the session’s biggest drag, plunging 9.6% after the logistics company reported a slow and disappointing start to FY2026, with profits down across its three main divisions.",/new-zealand/stock-market,verde
